# Discover my Solar System

*Bootstrap knowledge about the solar system from scratch.*

The goal of this project is to gather data about the solar system exclusively from first hand
observation and experimentation, starting from absolutely *nothing*. The plan is to get as far
as possible on a fixed budget.

## Motivation

I recently started being interested in all things space-related (thanks KSP!) and I'd like to get
involved in the global quest to make humans a spacefaring species.

I don't have a scientific background and I don't like the idea of spending years in a university
before getting into anything interesting, so I'm looking for some kind of fast track into being
a productive member of the global space exploration initiative.

I'm already a pretty good software developer, so if I manage to gain a bit of *street cred* on the
scientific side, I could potentially help significantly.

I read stuff about astronomy, space and all those things, but without an immediate goal, it's hard
to stay motivated in my learning endeavors. Hence, this project.

This is a self-exploratory project. I want to discover if there's a scientific hidden in me. If
this project goes well, I think I'll have a much better idea of what to do next.

## Rules

These are the rules I plan to follow for this project:

* Duration: 1 year (deadline: 18-07-2016)
* Budget: 3000$ (CAD). This includes all expenses related to this project. Gear, transportation,
  etc..
* I cannot use any known data about the solar system. Any data I use must come from past
  obsevations I've made myself.
* Other than budget, one restriction on gear: if it contains prior data, it's forbidden. GPS, for
  example, is forbidden because it relies on solar system data. Google maps too...
* No restriction on theory. I can read all I want about *how* to get my data. I will of course,
  during my readings, come across hard data about the solar system, which I'll do my best to
  ignore.
* No restrictions with universal physics laws. For example, I can use the speed of light constant
  because it's not specific to the solar system.
* I can shamelessly copying experiments I read about. The goal is not to simulate scientific
  breakthroughs. I just want to get my feet wet with the scientific method.
* I'll verify the quality of my data with the scientific method: prediction + experiment. I'll
  then be able to evaluate the accuracy of my data by checking how far off my predictions are.
* I document everything. If I can, I should also document my inspiration for how I conduct my
  experiments. Any program I use for calculation will be included in this repo.

## Initial impulse

I have no idea how far I'll get with this, but I hope to at least manage to get all I need to
calculate the orbit of Earth and the Moon. My first mission will be to figure out the size of the
Earth. My immediate concern is to figure out my position on Earth without relying on Google maps...
1, 2, 3, *GO*!
