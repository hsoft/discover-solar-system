# Mission 2: Sun's position at dusk and dawn

From past observation, we know that the sun generally rises east and falls west. However, depending
on seasons, it does not precisely show up at the same place every day.

The goal is to be able to accurately predict the sun's position at dusk and dawn on any given day.

## Method

Because watching the sun directly is hazardous for one's eyes, we'll use the sun's shadow instead.

We'll make ourselves a kind of sun dial with a small stick glued to a piece of wood. Then, a piece
of paper can be placed on that piece of wood so that we can record the angle of the sun's shadow
relative to the north (which we'll indicate on the paper using a compass).

By taking such readings regularly and consistently, we should be able to garner enough data to
extract a equation from it.

Conveniently, each reading could serve as a confirmation of our previous tentative equation.
